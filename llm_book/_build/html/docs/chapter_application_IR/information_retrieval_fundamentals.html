<h3><span class="section-number">22.1.1. </span>Ad-hoc Retrieval<a class="headerlink" href="#ad-hoc-retrieval" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Ad-hoc search and retrieval is a classic <strong>information retrieval (IR)</strong> task consisting of two steps: first, the user specifies his or her information need through a query; second, the information retrieval system fetches documents from a large corpus that are likely to be relevant to the query. Key elements in an ad-hoc retrieval system include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Query</strong>, the textual description of information need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Corpus</strong>, a large collection of textual documents to be retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relevance</strong> is about whether a retrieved document can meet the user’s information need.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There has been a long research and product development history on ad-hoc retrieval. Successful products in ad-hoc retrieval include Google search engine [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-adhocretrievaldemogoogle"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.2</span></a>] and Microsoft Bing [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-adhocretrievaldemobing"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.3</span></a>].<br />
One core component within Ad-hoc retrieval is text ranking. The returned documents from a retrieval system or a search engine are typically in the form of an ordered list of texts. These texts (web pages, academic papers, news, tweets, etc.) are ordered with respect to the relevance to the user’s query, or the user’s information need.</p>
<p>A major characteristic of ad-hoc retrieval is the heterogeneity of the query and the documents [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-querylengthdoclengthmsmarco"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.1</span></a>]. A user’s query often comes with potentially unclear intent and is usually very short, ranging from a few words to a few sentences. On the other hand, documents are typically from a different set of authors with varying writing styles and have longer text length, ranging from multiple sentences to many paragraphs. Such heterogeneity poses significant challenges for vocabulary match and semantic match for ad-hoc retrieval tasks.</p>

<p>There have been decades’ research and engineering efforts on developing ad-hoc retrieval models and system. Traditional IR systems primarily rely on techniques to identify exact term matches between a query and a document and compute final relevance score between various weighting schemes. Such exact matching approach has achieved tremendous success due to scalability and computational efficiency - fetching a handful of relevant document from billions of candidate documents. Unfortunately, exact match often suffers from vocabulary mismatch problem where sentences with similar meaning but in different terms are considered not matched. Recent development of deep neural network approach <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id112" title="Po-Sen Huang, Xiaodong He, Jianfeng Gao, Li Deng, Alex Acero, and Larry Heck. Learning deep structured semantic models for web search using clickthrough data.

Recently, combining exact matching with semantic matching is empowering many IR and search products.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">22.1.2. </span>Open-domain Question Answering<a class="headerlink" href="#open-domain-question-answering" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another application closely related IR is <strong>open-domain question answering (OpenQA)</strong>, which has found a widespread adoption in products like search engine, intelligent assistant, and automatic customer service. OpenQA is a task to answer factoid questions that humans might ask, using a large collection of documents (e.g., Wikipedia, Web page, or collected document) as the information source. An  OpenQA example is like</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is the capital of China?</em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>Beijing</em>.</p>
<p>Contrast to Ad-hoc retrieval, instead of simply returning a
list of relevant documents, the goal of OpenQA is to identify (or extract) a span of text that directly answers the user’s question. Specifically, for <em>factoid</em> question answering, the OpenQA system primarily focuses on questions that can be answered with short phrases or named entities such as dates, locations, organizations, etc.</p>
<p>A typical modern OpenQA system adopts a two-stage pipeline <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1459" title="Danqi Chen, Adam Fisch, Jason Weston, and Antoine Bordes. Reading wikipedia to answer open-domain questions. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00051, 2017.">CFWB17</a>]</span> [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-open-domainqa"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.4</span></a>]: (1) A document <strong>retriever</strong> selects a small set of relevant passages that probably contain the answer from a large-scale collection; (2) A document <strong>reader</strong> extracts the answer from relevant documents returned by the document retriever. Similar to ad-hoc search, relevant documents are required to be not only topically related to but also correctly address the question, which requires more semantics understanding beyond exact term matching features. One widely adopted strategy to improve OpenQA system with large corpus is to use an efficient document (or paragraph) retrieval technique to obtain a few relevant documents, and then use an accurate (yet expensive) reader model to read the retrieved documents and find the answer.</p>
<p>Nowadays many web search engines like Google and Bing have been evolving towards higher intelligence by incorporating OpenQA techniques into their search functionalities.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Compared with ad-hoc retrieval, OpenQA shows reduced heterogeneity between
the question and the answer passage/sentence yet add challenges of precisely understanding the question and locating passages that might contain answers. On one hand, the question is usually in natural language, which is longer than keyword queries and less ambiguous in intent. On the other hand, the answer passages/sentences are usually much shorter text spans than documents, leading to more concentrated topics/semantics. Retrieval and reader models need to capture the patterns expected in the answer passage/sentence based on the intent of the question, such as the matching of the context words, the existence of the expected answer type, and so on.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">22.1.3. </span>Modern IR Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#modern-ir-systems" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A traditional IR system, or concretely a search engine, operates through several key steps.</p>
<p>The first step is <strong>crawling</strong>.  A web search engines discover and collect web pages by crawling from site to site; Another vertical search engines such as e-commerce search
engines collect their product information from product description and other product meta data. The second step is <strong>indexing</strong>, which creates an inverted index that maps key words to document ids. The last step is <strong>searching</strong>. Searching is a process that accepts a text query as input, looks up relevant documents from the inverted index, ranks documents, and returns
a list of results, ranked by their relevance to the query.</p>

<p>The rapid progress of deep neural network learning <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id996" title="Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio. Deep learning. Volume 1. MIT press Cambridge, 2016.">GBCB16</a>]</span> and their profound impact on natural language processing has also reshaped IR systems and brought IR into a deep learning age. Deep neural networks (e.g., Transformers <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1230" title="Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. Bert: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805, 2018.">DCLT18</a>]</span>) have proved their unparalleled capability in semantic understanding over traditional IR margin yet they suffer from high computational cost and latency. This motivates the development of multi-stage retrieval and ranking IR system [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-retrieverankingarch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.6</span></a>] in order to better balance trade-offs between effectiveness (i.e., quality and accuracy of final results) and efficiency (i.e., computational cost and latency).</p>
<p>In this multi-stage pipeline, early stage models consists of simpler but more efficient models to reduce the candidate documents from billions to thousands; later stage models consists of complex models to perform accurate ranking for a handful of documents coming from early stages.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-retrieverankingarch">

<p>In modern search engine, traditional IR models, which is based on term matching, serve as good candidates for early stage model due to their efficiency. The core idea of the traditional approach is to count repetitions of query terms in the document. Large counts indicates higher relevance. Different transformation and weighting schemes for those counts lead to a variety of possible TF-IDF ranking features.</p>
<p>Later stage models are primarily deep learning model. Deep learning models in IR not only provide powerful representations of textual data that capture word and document semantics, allowing a machine to better under queries and documents, but also open doors to multi-modal (e.g., image, video) and multilingual search, ultimately paving the way for developing intelligent search engines that deliver rich contents to users.</p>

It is possible to use term matching between key words in URL or title and query terms for text ranking; It is also possible to simply memorize the user clicks between common queries between their ideal URLs. For example, a query <em>CNN</em> is always matched to the CNN landing page. These simple methods clearly do not require a semantic understanding on the query and the document content.</p>
<p>However, for new or tail queries as well as new and tail document, a semantic understanding on queries and documents is crucial. For these cases, there is a lack of click evidence between the queries and the documents, and therefore a model that capture the semantic-level relationship between the query and the document content is necessary for text ranking.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">22.1.4.1. </span>Query Understanding And Rewriting<a class="headerlink" href="#query-understanding-and-rewriting" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>A user’s query does not always have crystal clear description on the information need of the user. Rather, it often comes with potentially misspellings and unclear intent,  and is usually very short, ranging from a few words to a few sentences [<code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ch:neural-network-and-deep-learning:ApplicationNLP_IRSearch:tab:example_queries_MSMARCO</span></code>]. There are several challenges to understand the user’s query.</p>
<p>Users might use vastly different query representations even though they have the same search intent. For example, suppose users like to get information about <em>distance between Sun and Earth</em>. Common used queries could be</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>how far earth sun</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>distance from sun to earth</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>distance of earth from sun</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>how far earth is from the sun</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that some of them are just key words rather than a full sentence and some of them might not have the completely correct grammar.</p>
<p>There are also more challenging scenarios where queries are often poorly worded and far from describing the searcher’s actual information needs. Typically, we employ a query rewriting component to expand the search and increase recall,
i.e., to retrieve a larger set of results, with the hope that relevant results will not be missed. Such query rewriting component has multiple sub-components which are summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Spell checker</strong>
Spell checking queries is an important and necessary feature of modern search. Spell checking enhance user experience by fixing basic spelling mistakes like <em>itlian restaurat</em> to <em>italian restaurant</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Query expansion</strong>
Query expansion improves search result retrieval by adding or substituting terms to the user’s query. Essentially, these additional terms aim to minimize the mismatch between the searcher’s query and available documents. For example, the query <em>italian restaurant</em>, we can expand <em>restaurant</em> to <em>food</em> or <em>cuisine</em> to search all potential candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Query relaxation</strong>
The reverse of query expansion is query relaxation, which expand the search scope when the user’s query is too restrictive. For example, a search for <em>good Italian restaurant</em> can be relaxed to <em>italian restaurant</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Query intent understanding</strong>
This subcomponent aims to figure out the main intent behind the query, e.g., the query <em>coffee shop</em> most likely has a local intent (an interest in nearby places) and the query <em>earthquake</em> may have a news intent. Later on, this intent will help in selecting and ranking the best documents for the query.</p>
<p>Given a rewritten query, It is also important to correctly weigh specific terms in a query such that we can narrow down the search scope. Consider the query <em>NBA news</em>, a relevant document is expected to be about <em>NBA</em> and <strong>news</strong> but have more focus on <em>NBA</em>. There are traditional rule-based approach to determine the term importance as well as recent data-driven approach that determines the term importance based on sophisticated natural language and context understanding.</p>
<p>To improve relevance ranking, it is often necessary to incorporate additional context information (e.g., time, location, etc.) into the user’s query. For example, when a user types in a query <em>coffee shop</em>, retrieve coffee shops by ascending distance to the user’s location can generally improve relevance ranking. Still, there are challenges on deciding for which type of query we need to incorporate the context information.</p>

<p>Traditional IR systems retrieve documents mainly by matching keywords in documents with those in search queries. While in many cases exact term match naturally ensure semantic match, there are cases, exact term matching can be insufficient.</p>
<p>The first reason is due to the polysemy of words. That is, a word can mean different things depending on context. The meaning of <em>book</em> is different in <em>text book</em> and <em>book a hotel room</em>. Short queries particularly suffer from Polysemy because they are often devoid of context.</p>
<p>The second reason is due to the fact that a concept is often expressed using different vocabularies and language styles in documents and queries. As a result, such a model would have difficulty in retrieving documents that have none of the query terms but turn out to be relevant.</p>
<p>Modern neural-based IR model enable semantic retrieval by learning latent representations of text from data and enable document retrieval based on semantic similarity.</p>

<p>An IR system solely rely on semantic retrieval is vulnerable to queries that have rare words. This is because rare words are infrequent or even never appear in the training data and learned representation associated with rare words query might be poor due to the nature of data-driven learning. On the other hand, exact matching approach are robust to rare words and can precisely retrieve documents containing rare terms.</p>
<p>Another drawback of semantic retrieval is high false positives: retrieving documents that are only loosely related to the query.</p>
<p>Nowadays, much efforts have been directed to achieve a strong and intelligent modern IR system by combining exact match and semantic match approaches in different ways. Examples include joint optimization of hybrid exact match and semantic match systems, enhancing exact match via semantic based query and document expansion, etc.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">22.1.4.3. </span>Robustness To Document Variations<a class="headerlink" href="#robustness-to-document-variations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>In response to users’ queries and questions, IR systems needs to search a large collection of text documents, typically at the billion-level scale, to retrieve relevant ones. These documents are comprised of mostly unstructured natural language text, as compared to structured data like tables or forms.</p>
<p>Documents can vary in length, ranging <strong>from sentences</strong> (e.g., searching for similar questions in a community question answering application like Quora) <strong>to lengthy web pages</strong>. A long document might like a short document, covering a similar scope but with more words, which is also known as the <strong>Verbosity hypothesis</strong>. On the other hand, a long document might consist of a number of unrelated short documents concatenated together, which is known as <strong>Scope hypothesis</strong>. The wide variation of document forms lead to different strategies. For example, following the Verbosity hypothesis a long document is represented by a single feature vector. Following the Scope hypothesis, one can break a long document into several semantically distinctive parts and represent each of them as separate feature vectors. We can consider each part as the unit of retrieval or rank the long document by aggregating evidence across its constituent parts.<br />
For full-text scientific articles, we might choose to only consider article titles and abstracts, and ignoring most of the numerical results and analysis.</p>
<p>There are also challenges on breaking a long document into semantically distinctive parts and encode each part into meaningful representation. Recent neural network methods extract semantic parts by clustering tokens in the hidden space and represent documents by multi-vector representations<span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1450" title="Samuel Humeau, Kurt Shuster, Marie-Anne Lachaux, and Jason Weston.

<p>IR product such as search engines often serve a huge pool of user and need to handle tremendous volume of search requests during peak time (e.g., when there is breaking news events). To provide the best user experience, computational efficiency of IR models often directly affect user perceived latency. A long standing challenge is to achieve high accuracy/relevance in fetched documents yet to maintain a low latency. While traditional IR methods based on exact term match has excellent computational efficiency and scalability, it suffers from low accuracy due to the vocabulary and semantic mismatch problems. Recent progress in deep learning and natural language process are highlighted by complex transformer-based model <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1230" title="Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova.

<p>To alleviate the computational bottleneck from deep learning based dense retrieval, state-of-the-art search engines also adopts a multi-stage retrieval pipeline system: an efficient first-stage retriever uses a query to fetch a set of documents from the entire document collection, and subsequently one or more more powerful retriever to refine the results.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">22.2. </span>Text Ranking Evaluation Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#text-ranking-evaluation-metrics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Consider a large corpus containing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> documents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D=\{d_1,...,d_N\}\)</span>. Given a query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, suppose the retriever and its subsequent re-ranker (if there is) ultimately produce an ordered list of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> relevant document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_q = \{d_{i_1},...,d_{i_k}\}\)</span>, where documents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i_1},...,d_{i_k} \)</span> are ranked by some relevance measure with respect to the query.</p>
<p>In the following, we discuss several commonly used metrics to evaluate text ranking quality and IR system.</p>
<section id="precision-and-recall">
<h3><span class="section-number">22.2.1. </span>Precision And Recall<a class="headerlink" href="#precision-and-recall" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Precision</strong> and <strong>recall</strong> are metrics concerns the fraction of relevant documents retrieved for a query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, but they are not concerned with the ranking order.
Specifically, precision computes the fraction of relevant documents with respect to  the total number of documents in the retrieved set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{q}\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{q}\)</span> have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> documents; Recall computes the fraction of relevant documents with respect to the total number of relevant documents in the corpus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span>. More formally, we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
\operatorname{Precision}_{q}&#64;K &amp;=\frac{\sum_{d \in R_{q}} \operatorname{rel}_{q}(d)}{\left|R_{q}\right|} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{d \in R_{q}} \operatorname{rel}_{q}(d)\\
	\operatorname{Recall}_{q}&#64;K &amp;=\frac{\sum_{d \in R_{q}} \operatorname{rel}_{q}(d)}{\sum_{d \in D} \operatorname{rel}_{q}(d)}
\end{align*}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\operatorname{rel}_{q}(d)\)</span> is a binary indicator function indicating if document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is relevant to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>. Note that the denominator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{d \in D} \operatorname{rel}_{q}(d)\)</span> is the total number of relevant documents in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span>, which is a constant.</p>
<p>Typically, we only retrieve a fixed number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> of documents, i.e., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|R_q| = K\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> typically takes 100 to 1000. The precision and recall at a given <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> can be computed over the total number of queries <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>, that is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
\operatorname{Precision}&#64;{K} &amp;=\frac{1}{|Q|}\sum_{q\in Q} \operatorname{Precision}_{q}&#64;K \\

<h3><span class="section-number">22.2.2. </span>Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)<a class="headerlink" href="#normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain-ndcg" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When we are evaluating retrieval and ranking results based on their relevance to the query, we normally evaluate the ranking result in the following way</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ranking result is good if documents with high relevance appear in the top several positions in search engine result list.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect documents with different degree of relevance should contribute to the final ranking in proportion to their relevance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cumulative Gain (CG)</strong> is the sum of the graded relevance scores of all documents in the search result list. CG only considers the relevance of the documents in the search result list, and does not consider the position of these documents in the result list. Given the ranking position of a result list, CG can be defined as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[CG&#64;k = \sum_{i=1}^k s_i\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> is the relevance score, or custom defined gain, of document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> in the result list. The relevance score of a document is typically provided by human annotators.</p>
<p><strong>Discounted cumulative gain (DCG)</strong> is the discounted version of CG. The gain is accumulated from the top of the result list to the bottom, with the gain of each result discounted at lower ranks.</p>
<p>The traditional formula of DCG accumulated at a particular rank position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
DCG&#64;k=\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{s_{i}}{\log_{2}(i+1)}=s_{1}+\sum_{i=2}^{k} \frac{s_{i}}{\log _{2}(i+1)}.
\]</div>
<p>An alternative formulation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(DCG\)</span> places stronger emphasis on more relevant documents:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
{DCG}&#64;k=\sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{2^{rel_q(d_i)}-1}{\log _{2}(i+1)}.
\]</div>
<p>The <strong>ideal DCG</strong>, <strong>IDCG</strong>, is computed the same way but by sorting all the candidate  documents in the corpus by their relative relevance so that it produces the max possible DCG&#64;k. The <strong>normalized DCG</strong>, <strong>NDCG</strong>, is then given by,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
NDCG&#64;k=\frac{DCG&#64;k}{IDCG&#64;k}.

<h3><span class="section-number">22.2.3. </span>Online Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#online-metrics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When a text ranking model is deployed to serve user’s request, we can also measure the model performance by tracking several online metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Click-through rate and dwell time</strong> When a user types a query and starts a search session, we can measure the success of a search session on user’s reactions. On a per-query level, we can define success via click-through rate.
The Click-through rate (CTR) measures the ratio of clicks to impressions.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\operatorname{CTR} = \frac{\text{Number of clicks}}{\text{Number of impressions}},\]</div>
<p>where an impression means a page displayed on the search result page a search engine result page and a click means that the user clicks the page.</p>
<p>One problem with the click-through rate is we cannot simply treat a click as the success of document retrieval and ranking. For example, a click might be immediately followed by a click back as the user quickly realizes the clicked doc is not what he is looking for. We can alleviate this issue by removing clicks that have a short dwell time.</p>
<p><strong>Time to success</strong>: Click-through rate only considers the search session of a single query. In real application case, a user’s search experience might span multiple query sessions until he finds what he needs. For example, the users initially search <em>action movies</em> and they do not find that the ideal results and refine the initial query to a more specific one: <em>action movies by Jackie Chan</em>. Ideally, we can measure the time spent by the user in identifying the page he wants as a metrics.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">22.3.1. </span>Exact Match Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#exact-match-framework" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Most traditional approaches to ad-hoc retrieval simply count repetitions of the query terms in the document text and assign proper weights to matched terms to calculate a final matching score. This framework, also known as exact term matching, despite its simplicity, serves as a foundation for many IR systems. A variety of traditional IR methods fall into this framework and they mostly differ in different weighting (e.g., tf-idf) and term normalization (e.g., dogs to dog) schemes.</p>
<p>In the exact term matching, we represent a query and a document by a set of their constituent terms, that is, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q = \{t^{q}_1,...,t^q_M\}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d = \{t^{d}_1,...,t^d_M\}\)</span>. The matching score between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> with respect to a vocabulary <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> is given by:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
S(q, d)= \sum_{t\in V} f(t)\cdot\mathbb{1}(t\in q\cap d) = \sum_{t \in q \cap d} f(t)
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is some function of a term and its associated statistics, the three most important of which are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Term frequency (how many times a term occurs in a document);</p></li>
<li><p>Document frequency (the number of documents that contain at least once instance of the term);</p></li>
<li><p>Document length (the length of the document that the term occurs in).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Exact term match framework estimates document relevance based on the count of only the query terms in the document. The position of these occurrences and relationship with other terms in the document are ignored.</p>
<p>BM25 are based on exact matching of query and document words, which
limits the in- formation available to the ranking model and may lead to problems such
vocabulary mismatch</p>

<section id="tf-idf-vector-space-model">
<h3><span class="section-number">22.3.2. </span>TF-IDF Vector Space Model<a class="headerlink" href="#tf-idf-vector-space-model" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the vector space model, we represent each query or document by a vector in a high dimensional space. The vector representation has the dimensionality equal to the vocabulary size, and in which each vector component corresponds to a term in the vocabulary of the collection. This query vector representation stands in contrast to the term vector representation of the previous section, which included only the terms appearing in the query. Given a query vector and a set of document vectors, one for each document in the collection, we rank the documents by computing a similarity measure between the query vector and each document</p>
<p>The most commonly used similarity scoring function for a document vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{d}\)</span> and a query vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{q}\)</span> is the cosine similarity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\operatorname{Sim}(\vec{d}, \vec{q})\)</span> is computed as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\operatorname{Sim}(\vec{d}, \vec{q})=\frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{|\vec{q}|}.
\]</div>
<p>The component value associated with term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is typically the product of term frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf(t)\)</span> and inverse document frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(idf(t)\)</span>. In addition, cosine similarity has a length normalization component that implicitly handles issues related to document length.</p>
<p>Over the years there have been a number of popular variants for both the TF and the IDF functions have been proposed and evaluated. A basic version of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf(t)\)</span> is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
tf(t,d)= \begin{cases}\log \left(f_{t, d}\right)+1 &amp; \text { if } f_{t, d}&gt;0 \\ 0 &amp; \text { otherwise. }\end{cases}
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{t, d}\)</span> is the actual term frequency count of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> in document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>
Here the basic intuition is that a term appearing many times in a document should be assigned a higher weight for that document, and the its value should not necessarily increase linearly with the actual term frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{t, d}\)</span>, hence the logarithm. Although two occurrences of a term should be given more weight than one occurrence, they shouldn’t necessarily be given twice the weight.</p>
<p>A common <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(idf(t)\)</span> functions is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
idf(t)=\log \left(N / N_{t}\right)
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_t\)</span> is the number of documents in the corpus that contain the term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> is the total number of documents. Here the basic intuition behind the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(idf\)</span> functions is that a term appearing in many documents should be assigned a lower weight than a term appearing in few documents.</p>

<p>At first sight, BM25 looks quite like a traditional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf\times idf\)</span> weight - a product of two components, one based on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf\)</span> and one on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(idf\)</span>. However, there is one significant difference. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf\)</span> component in the BM25 uses some saturation mechanism to discount the impact of frequent terms in a document.
Intuitively, a document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> has a higher BM25 score if</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Many query terms also frequently occur in the document;</p></li>
<li><p>These frequent co-occurring terms have larger idf values (i.e., they are not common terms).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>BM25 does not concerns with word semantics, that is whether the word is
a noun or a verb, or the meaning of each word. It is only sensitive to which are common words and which are rare words, and the document length. If one query contains both common words and rare words, this method puts more weight on the rare words and returns documents with more rare words in the query. Besides, a term saturation mechanism is applied to decrease the matching signal when a matched word appears too frequently in the document. A document-length normalization mechanism is used to discount term weight when a document is longer than average documents in the collection.</p>
<p>Two parameters in BM25, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>, are designed to perform <strong>term frequency saturation</strong>
and <strong>document-length normalization</strong>,respectively.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{1}\)</span> determines how the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf\)</span> component of the term weight changes as the frequency increases. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{1}=0\)</span>, the term frequency component would be ignored and only term presence or absence would matter. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{1}\)</span> is large, the term weight component would increase nearly linearly with the frequency.</p></li>
<li><p>The constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> regulates the impact of the length normalization, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b=0\)</span> corresponds to no length normalization, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b=1\)</span> is full normalization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the query is long, then we might also use similar weighting for query terms. This is appropriate if the queries are paragraph-long information needs, but unnecessary for short queries.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
BM25(q, d)=\sum_{t_q \in q\cap d} idf(t_q) \cdot \frac{\left(k_{1}+1\right) tf(t_q,d) }{k_{1}\left((1-b)+b \times  |d|/avgdl\right)+tf(t_q,d)} \cdot \frac{\left(k_{3}+1\right) tf(t_q,q)}{k_{2}+tf(t_q,q)}
\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(tf(t_q, q)\)</span> being the frequency of term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> in the query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{2}\)</span> being another positive tuning parameter that this time calibrates term frequency scaling of the query.</p>

<p>For ad-hoc search, traditional exact-term matching models (e.g., BM25) are playing critical roles in both traditional IR systems [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-traditionalirengine"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.5</span></a>] and modern multi-stage pipelines [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-retrieverankingarch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.6</span></a>]. Unfortunately, exact-term matching inherently suffers from the vocabulary mismatch problem due to the fact that a concept is often expressed using different vocabularies and language styles in documents and queries.</p>
<p>Early latent semantic models such as <strong>latent semantic analysis (LSA)</strong> illustrated the idea of identifying semantically relevant documents for a query when lexical matching is insufficient. However, their effectiveness in addressing the language discrepancy between documents and search queries are limited by their weak modeling capacity (i.e., simple, linear models). Also, these model parameters are typically learned via the unsupervised learning, i.e., by grouping different terms that occur in a similar context into the same semantic cluster.</p>
<p>The introduction of deep neural networks for semantic modeling and retrieval was pioneered in <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id112" title="Po-Sen Huang, Xiaodong He, Jianfeng Gao, Li Deng, Alex Acero, and Larry Heck.

<h3><span class="section-number">22.4.2. </span>Two Architecture Paradigms<a class="headerlink" href="#two-architecture-paradigms" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The current neural  architecture paradigms for IR can be categorized into two classes: <strong>representation-based</strong> and <strong>interaction-based</strong> [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-twoparadigms"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.8</span></a>].</p>
<p>In the representation-based architecture, a query and a document are encoded independently into two embedding vectors, then their relevance is estimated based on a single similarity score between the two embedding vectors.</p>
<p>Here we would like to make a critical distinction on symmetric vs. asymmetric encoding:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For <strong>symmetric encoding</strong>, the query and the entries in the corpus are typically of the similar length and have the same amount of content and they are encoded using the same network. Symmetric encoding is used for symmetric semantic search. An example would be searching for similar questions. For instance, the query could be <em>How to learn Python online?</em> and the entry that satisfies the search is like <em>How to learn Python on the web?</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>For <strong>asymmetric encoding</strong>, we usually have a short query (like a question or some keywords) and we would like to find a longer paragraph answering the query; they are encoded using two different networks. An example would be information retrieval. The entry is typically a paragraph or a web-page.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the interaction-based architecture, instead of directly encoding <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> into individual embeddings, term-level interaction features across the query and the document are first constructed. Then a deep neural network is used to extract high-level matching features from the interactions and produce a final relevance score.</p>

<p>These two architectures have different strengths in modeling relevance and final model serving. For example, a representation-based model architecture makes it possible to pre-compute and cache document representations offline, greatly reducing the online computational load per query. However, the pre-computation of query-independent document representations often miss term-level matching features that are critical to construct high-quality retrieval results. On the other hand, interaction-based architectures are often good at capturing the fine-grained matching feature between the query and the document.</p>
<p>Since interaction-based models can model interactions between word pairs in queries and document, they are effective for <strong>re-ranking</strong>, but are cost-prohibitive for first-stage retrieval as the expensive document-query interactions must be computed online for all ranked documents.</p>
<p>Representation-based models enable low-latency, full-collection retrieval with a dense index. By representing queries and documents with dense vectors, retrieval is reduced to nearest neighbor search, or a maximum inner product search (MIPS) <span id="id12">[]</span> problem if similarity is represented by an inner product.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been increasing effort on accelerating maximum inner product and nearest neighbor search, which led to high-quality implementations of libraries for nearest neighbor search such as hnsw <span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1503" title="Yu A Malkov and Dmitry A Yashunin.

First, we represent a query and a document (only its title) by a sparse vector, respectively.

<p>To represent word features in the query and the documents, DSSM adopt a word level sparse term vector representation with letter 3-gram vocabulary, whose size is approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30k \approx 30^3\)</span>. Here 30 is the approximate number of alphabet letters. This is also known as a letter trigram word hashing technique. In other words, both query and the documents will be represented by sparse vectors with dimensionality of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30k\)</span>.</p>
<p>The usage of letter 3-gram vocabulary has multiple benefits compared to the full vocabulary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Avoid OOV problem with finite-size vocabulary or term vector dimensionality.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of letter n-gram can capture morphological meanings of words.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One problem of this method is collision, i.e., two different
words could have the same letter n-gram vector representation because this is a bag-of-words representation that does not take into account orders. But the collision probability is rather low.</p>

<p><strong>Training</strong>. The neural network model is trained on the clickthrough data to map a query and its relevant document to vectors that are similar to each other and vice versa. The click-through logs consist of a list of queries and their clicked documents. It is assumed that a query is relevant, at least partially, to the documents that are clicked on for that query.</p>
<p>The semantic relevance score between a query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> and a document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is given by:</p>

<p>The first application of BERT in document retrieval is using BERT as a cross encoder, where the query token sequence and the document token sequence are concatenated via [SEP] token and encoded together. This architecture [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-monobertarch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.11</span></a>], called mono-BERT, was first proposed by <span id="id21">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1449" title="Rodrigo Nogueira and Kyunghyun Cho.

<p>Mono-BERT can be characterized as a <em>pointwise</em> approach for ranking.

Multi-stage document ranking with bert. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.14424, 2019.">NYCL19</a>]</span> also proposed duo-BERT, which is  a <em>pairwise</em> ranking approach. In this pairwise approach, the duo-BERT ranker model estimates the probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{i, j}\)</span> of the candidate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i}\)</span> being more relevant than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{j}\)</span> with respect to query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>The duo-BERT architecture [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-duobertarch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.12</span></a>] takes the concatenation of the query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, the candidate document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i}\)</span>, and the candidate document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{j}\)</span> as the input.

<p>Once the input sequence is passed through the model, we use the [CLS] embedding as input to a single layer neural network to obtain a posterior probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{i,j}\)</span>. This posterior probability can be used to rank documents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> with respect to each other.

<p>With BERT variants of different ranking capability, we can construct a multi-stage ranking architecture to select a handful of most relevant document from a large collection of candidate documents given a query. Consider a typical architecture comprising a number of stages from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span> ot <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_N\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span> is a exact-term matching stage using from an inverted index. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span> stage take billion-scale document as input and output thousands of candidates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span>. For stages from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_N\)</span>, each stage <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{n}\)</span> receives a ranked list <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{n-1}\)</span> of candidates from the previous stage and output candidate list <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n\)</span>. Typically <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|R_n| \ll |R_{n-1}|\)</span> to enable efficient retrieval.</p>
<p>An example three-stage retrieval-ranking system is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-multistageretrievalrankingbert"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.13</span></a>. In the first stage <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{0}\)</span>, given a query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, the top candidate documents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{0}\)</span> are retrieved using BM25. In the second stage <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{1}\)</span>, monoBERT produces a relevance score <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{i}\)</span> for each pair of query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> and candidate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i} \in R_{0}.\)</span> The top candidates with respect to these relevance scores are passed to the last stage <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{2}\)</span>, in which duoBERT computes a relevance score <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{i, j}\)</span> for each triple <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(q, d_{i}, d_{j}\right)\)</span>. The final list of candidates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{2}\)</span> is formed by re-ranking the candidates according to these scores .</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> Different multistage architecture configurations are evaluated using the MS MARCO dataset. We have following observations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using a single stage of BM25 yields the worst performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding an additional monoBERT significantly improve the performance over the single BM25 stage architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding the third component duoBERT only yields a diminishing gain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the author found that	employing the technique of Target Corpus Pre-training (TCP)\ gives additional performance gain. Specifically, the BERT backbone will undergo a two-phase pre-training. In the first phase, the model is pre-trained using the original setup, that is Wikipedia (2.5B words) and the Toronto Book corpus ( 0.8B words) for one million iterations. In the second phase, the model is further pre-trained on the MS MARCO corpus.</p>

<p>One way to improve the computational efficiency of cross-encoder is to employ bi-encoders for partial separate encoding and then employ an additional shallow module for cross encoding. One example is the architecture shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-dcbert"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.14</span></a>, which is called <strong>DC-BERT</strong> and proposed in <span id="id25">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1474" title="Ping Nie, Yuyu Zhang, Xiubo Geng, Arun Ramamurthy, Le Song, and Daxin Jiang.

The overall architecture of DC-BERT  consists of a dual-BERT component for decoupled encoding, a Transformer component for question-document interactions, and a binary classifier component for document relevance scoring.</p>
<p>The document encoder can be run offline to pre-encodes all documents and caches all term representations. During online inference, we only need to run the BERT query encodes online. Then the obtained contextual term representations are fed into high-layer Transformer interaction layer.</p>

<p><strong>Dual-BERT component</strong>. DC-BERT contains two pre-trained BERT models to independently encode the question and each retrieved document. During training, the parameters of both BERT models are fine-tuned to optimize the learning objective.</p>
<p><strong>Transformer component.</strong> The dual-BERT components produce contextualized embeddings for both the query token sequence and the document token sequence. Then we add global position embeddings <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{E}_{P_{i}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}\)</span> and segment embedding again to re-encode the position information and segment information (i.e., query vs document). Both the global position and segment embeddings are initialized from pre-trained BERT, and will be fine-tuned. The number of Transformer layers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> is configurable to trade-off between the model capacity and efficiency. The Transformer layers are initialized by the last <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> layers of pre-trained BERT, and are fine-tuned during the training.</p>
<p><strong>Classifier component.</strong> The two CLS token output from the Transformer layers will be fed into a linear binary classifier to predict whether the retrieved document is relevant to the query. Following previous work (Das et al., 2019; Htut et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018), we employ paragraph-level distant supervision to gather labels for training the classifier, where a paragraph that contains the exact ground truth answer span is labeled as a positive example. We parameterize the binary classifier as a MLP layer on top of the Transformer layers:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
p\left(q_{i}, d_{j}\right)=\sigma\left(\operatorname{Linear}\left(\left[o_{[C L S]} ; o_{[C L S]}^{\prime}\right]\right)\right)
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(q_{i}, d_{j}\right)\)</span> is a pair of question and retrieved document, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(o_{[C L S]}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(o_{[C L S]}^{\prime}\)</span> are the Transformer output encodings of the [CLS] token of the question and the document, respectively. The MLP parameters are updated by minimizing the cross-entropy loss.</p>
<p>DC-BERT uses one Transformer layer for question-document interactions. Quantized BERT is a 8bit-Integer model. DistilBERT is a compact BERT model with 2 Transformer layers.</p>
<p>We first compare the retriever speed. DC-BERT achieves over 10x speedup over the BERT-base retriever, which demonstrates the efficiency of this method. Quantized BERT has the same model architecture as BERT-base, leading to the minimal speedup. DistilBERT achieves about 6x speedup with only 2 Transformer layers, while BERT-base uses 12 Transformer layers.</p>
<p>With a 10x speedup, DC-BERT still achieves similar retrieval performance compared to BERT- base on both datasets. At the cost of little speedup, Quantized BERT also works well in ranking documents. DistilBERT performs significantly worse than BERT-base, which shows the limitation of the distilled BERT model.</p>

<p>To further investigate the impact of our model architecture design, we compare the performance of DC-BERT and its variants, including 1) DC-BERT-Linear, which uses linear layers instead of Transformers for interaction; and 2) DC-BERT-LSTM, which uses LSTM and bi- linear layers for interactions following previous work (Min et al., 2018). We report the results in Table 3. Due to the simplistic architecture of the interaction layers, DC-BERT-Linear achieves the best speedup but has significant performance drop, while DC-BERT-LSTM achieves slightly worse performance and speedup than DC-BERT.</p>

<p>The query Encoder take query tokens as the input. Note that if a query is shorter than a pre-defined number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_q\)</span>, it will be padded with BERT’s special [mask] tokens up to length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_q\)</span>; otherwise, only the first <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_q\)</span> tokens will be kept. It is found that the mask token padding serves as some sort of query augmentation and brings perform gain. In additional, a [Q] token is placed right after BERT’s sequence start token [CLS]. The query encoder then computes a contextualized representation for the query tokens.</p>
<p>The document encoder has a very similar architecture. A [D] token is placed right after BERT’s sequence start token [CLS]. Note that after passing through the encoder, embeddings correponding to punctuation symbols are filtered out.</p>
<p>Given BERT’s representation of each token, an additional linear layer with no activation is used to reduce the dimensionality reduction. The reduced dimensionality <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> is set much smaller than BERT’s fixed hidden dimension.</p>
<p>Finally, given <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q= q_{1} \ldots q_{l}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d=d_{1} \ldots d_{n}\)</span>, an additional CNN layer is used to allow each embedding vector to interact with its neighbor, yielding  the bags of embeddings <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_{q}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_{d}\)</span> in the following manner.</p>

<p>In the late interaction phase, every query embedding interacts with all document embeddings via a MaxSimilarity operator, which computes maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity), and the scalar outputs of these operators are summed across query terms.</p>
<p>Formally, the final similarity score between the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

ColBERT is differentiable end-to-end and we can fine-tune the BERT encoders and train from scratch the additional parameters (i.e., the linear layer and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([Q]\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([D]\)</span> markers’ embeddings). Notice that the final aggregation interaction mechanism has no trainable parameters.</p>
<p>The retrieval performance of ColBERT is evaluated on MS MARCO dataset. Compared with traditional exact term matching retrieval, ColBERT has shortcomings in terms of latency but MRR is significantly better.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">22.5.2. </span>Training Data<a class="headerlink" href="#training-data" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In a typical model learning setting, we construct training data from user search log, which contains queries issued by users and the documents they clicked after issuing the query. The basic assumption is that a query and a document are relevant if the user clicked the document.</p>
<p>Model learning in information retrieval typically falls into the category of contrastive learning. The query and the clicked document form a positive example; the query and irrelevant documents form negative examples. For retrieval problems, it is often the case that positive examples are available explicitly, while negative examples are unknown and need to be selected from an extremely large pool. The strategy of selecting negative examples plays an important role in determining quality of the encoders. In the most simple case, we randomly select unclicked documents as irrelevant document, or negative example. We defer the discussion of advanced negative example selecting strategy to <a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-negativesamplingstrategies"><span class="std std-numref">Section 22.6</span></a>.</p>
<p>When there is a shortage of annotation data or click behavior data, we can also leverage weakly supervised data for training <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1437" title="Mostafa Dehghani, Hamed Zamani, Aliaksei Severyn, Jaap Kamps, and W Bruce Croft.

In the weakly supervised data, labels or signals are obtained from an unsupervised ranking model, such as BM25.

<h4><span class="section-number">22.5.3.1. </span>Pointwise Regression Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#pointwise-regression-objective" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The idea of pointwise regression objective is to model the numerical relevance score for a given query-document. During inference time, the relevance scores between a set of candidates and a given query can be predicted and ranked.</p>
<p>During training, given a set of query-document pairs <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(q_{i}, d_{i, j}\right)\)</span> and their corresponding relevance score <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{i, j} \in [0, 1]\)</span> and their prediction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(q_i,d_{i,j})\)</span>. A pointwise regression objective tries to optimize a model to predict the relevance score via minimization</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[L = -\sum_{i} \sum_{j} (f(q_i,d_{i,j})) - y_{i,j})^2.
\]</div>
<p>Using a regression objective offer flexible for the user to model different levels of relevance between queries and documents. However, such flexibility also comes with** a requirement that the target relevance score should be accurate in absolute scale.**
While human annotated data might provide absolute relevance score, human annotation data is expensive and small scale. On the other hand, absolute relevance scores that are approximated by click data can be noisy and less optimal for regression objective. To make** training robust to label noises**, one can consider <strong>Pairwise ranking objectives.</strong> This particularly important in weak supervision scenario with noisy label. Using the ranking objective alleviates this issue by forcing the 	model to learn a preference function rather than reproduce absolute scores.</p>

<section id="pointwise-ranking-objective">
<span id="ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-pointwise-ranking-loss"></span><h4><span class="section-number">22.5.3.2. </span>Pointwise Ranking Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#pointwise-ranking-objective" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The idea of pointwise ranking objective is to simplify a ranking problem to a binary classification problem. Specifically, given a set of query-document pairs <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(q_{i}, d_{i, j}\right)\)</span> and their corresponding relevance label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{i, j} \in \{0, 1\}\)</span>, where 0 denotes irrelevant and 1 denotes relevant. A pointwise learning objective tries to optimize a model to predict the relevance label.</p>
<p>A commonly used pointwise loss functions is the binary Cross Entropy loss:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
L=-\sum_{i} \sum_{j} y_{i, j} \log \left(p\left(q_{i}, d_{i, j}\right)\right)+\left(1-y_{i, j}\right) \log \left(1-p\left(q_{i}, d_{i, j}\right)\right)
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\left(q_{i}, d{i, j}\right)\)</span> is the predicted probability of document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i,j}\)</span> being relevant to query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The advantages of pointwise ranking objectives are two-fold. First, pointwise ranking objectives are computed based on each query-document pair <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(q_{i}, d_{i, j}\right)\)</span> separately, which makes it simple and easy to scale. Second, the outputs of neural models learned with pointwise loss functions often have real meanings and value in practice. For instance, in sponsored search, the predicted the relevance probability can be used in ad bidding, which is more important than creating a good result list in some application scenarios.</p>
<p>In general, however, pointwise ranking objectives are considered to be less effective in ranking tasks. Because pointwise loss functions consider no document preference or order information, they do not guarantee to produce the best ranking list when the model loss reaches the global minimum. Therefore, better ranking paradigms that directly optimize document ranking based on pairwise loss functions and even listwise loss functions.</p>

<p>Pointwise ranking loss aims to optimize the model to directly predict relevance between query and documents on absolute score. From embedding optimization perspective, it train the neural query/document encoders to produce similar embedding vectors for a query and its relevant document and dissimilar embedding vectors for a query and its irrelevant documents.</p>
<p>On the other hand, pairwise ranking objectives focus on <strong>optimizing the relative preferences between documents rather than predicting their relevance labels.</strong> In contrast to pointwise methods where the final ranking loss is the sum of loss on each document, pairwise loss functions are computed based on the different combination of document pairs.</p>
<p>One of the most common pairwise ranking loss function is the <strong>triplet loss</strong>. Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{D}=\left\{\left\langle q_{i}, d_{i}^{+}, d_{i}^{-}\right\rangle\right\}_{i=1}^{m}\)</span> be the training data organized into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> triplets. Each triplet contains one query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{i}\)</span> and one relevant document <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i}^{+}\)</span>, along with one irrelevant (negative) documents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{i}^{-}\)</span>. Negative documents are typically randomly sampled from a large corpus or are strategically constructed [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-negativesamplingstrategies"><span class="std std-numref">Section 22.6</span></a>].

Triplet loss helps guide the encoder networks to pull relevant query and document closer and push irrelevant query and document away.</p>
<p>The loss function is given by</p>

<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\operatorname{Sim}(q, d)\)</span> is the similarity score produced by the network between the query and the document and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> is a hyper-parameter adjusting the margin.

<p>From the ranking perspective, both retrieval and re-ranking requires the generation of some order on the input samples. For example, given a query <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> and a set of candidate documents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((d_1,...,d_N)\)</span>. We need the model to produce an order list <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_2 \succ d_3 ... \succ d_k\)</span> according to their relevance to the query.</p>
<p>To train a model to produce the expected results during inference, we should ensure the training data distribution to matched with the inference time data distribution.
Particularly, the inference time the candidate document distribution and ranking granularity  differ vastly for retrieval tasks and re-ranking tasks [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-retrievalrerankingtask"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.21</span></a>]. Specifically,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the retrieval task, we typically need to identify top <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k (k=1000-10000)\)</span> relevant documents from the entire document corpus. This is achieved by ranking all documents in the corpus with respect to the relevance of the query.</p></li>
<li><p>For the re-ranking task, we need to identify the top <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k (k=10)\)</span> most relevant documents from the relevant documents generated by the retrieval task.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, features most useful in the retrieval task (i.e., distinguish relevant from irrelevant) are often not the same as the features most useful in re-ranking task (i.e., distinguish most relevant from less relevant). Therefore, the training samples for retrieval and re-ranking need to be constructed differently.</p>

<p>Constructing the proper training data distribution is more challenging to retrieval stage than the re-ranking stage. In re-ranking stage, data in the training and inference phases are both the documents from previous retrieval stages. In the retrieval stage, we need to construct training examples in a mini-batch fashion in a way that each batch approximates the distribution in the inference phase as close as possible.</p>
<p>This section will mainly focus on constructing training examples for retrieval model training in an efficient and effective way. Since the number of negative examples (i.e., irrelevant documents) significantly outnumber the number of positive examples.

<!-- #### Overview

The essence of the negative sampling algorithm is to set or adjust the sampling distribution during negative sampling based on certain methods. According to the way the negative sampling algorithm sets the sampling distribution, we can divide the current negative sampling algorithms into two categories: Heuristic Negative Sampling Algorithms and Model-based Negative Sampling Algorithms.

In {cite}`karpukhin2020dense`, there are three different types of negatives: (1) Random: any random passage from the corpus; (2) BM25: top passages returned by BM25 which don’t contain the answer but match most question tokens; (3) Gold: positive passages paired with other questions which appear in the training set.

One approach to improving the effectiveness of single-vector bi-encoders is hard negative mining, by training with carefully selected negative examples that emphasize discrimination between relevant and non-relevant texts.

both large in-batch negative sampling and asynchronous ANN index updates are computationally demanding.

Compared with the two heuristic algorithms mentioned above, the model-based negative sampling algorithm is easier to pick high-quality negative examples, and it is also the more cutting-edge sampling algorithm at present. Here are several model-based negative sampling algorithms: -->
<section id="random-negatives-and-in-batch-negatives">
<span id="ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-in-batch-negatives"></span><h4><span class="section-number">22.6.2.1. </span>Random Negatives and In-batch Negatives<a class="headerlink" href="#random-negatives-and-in-batch-negatives" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Random negative sampling</strong> is the most basic negative sampling algorithm. The algorithm uniformly sample documents from the corpus and treat it as a negative. Clearly, random negatives can generate negatives that are <strong>too easy</strong> for the model. For example, a negative document that is topically different from the query. These easy negatives lower the learning efficiency, that is, each batch produces limited information gain to update the model. Still, random negatives are widely used because of its simplicity.</p>
<p>In practice, random negatives are implemented as in-batch negatives.  In the contrastive learning framework with N-pair loss [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-n-pair-loss"><span class="std std-numref">Section 22.5.3.4</span></a>], we construct a mini-batch of query-doc examples like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{(q_1, d_1^+, d_{1,1}^-, d_{1,M}^-), ..., (q_N, d_N^+, d_{N,1}^-, d_{N,M}^M)\}\)</span>, Naively implementing N-pair loss would increase computational cost from constructing sufficient negative documents corresponding to each query. In-batch negatives<span id="id36">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1461" title="Vladimir Karpukhin, Barlas Oğuz, Sewon Min, Patrick Lewis, Ledell Wu, Sergey Edunov, Danqi Chen, and Wen-tau Yih.

The critical assumption here is that queries in a mini-batch are vastly different semantically, and positive documents from other queries would be confidently used as negatives. The assumption is largely true since each mini-batch is randomly sampled from the set of all training queries, in-batch negative document are usually true negative although they might not be hard negatives.</p>

<p>Specifically, assume that we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> queries in a mini-batch and each one is associated with a relevant  positive document. By using positive document of other queries, each query will have an additional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N - 1\)</span> negatives.</p>
<p>Formally, we can define our batch-wise loss function as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mathcal{L}:=\sum_{1 \leq i \leq N}\left(\sum_{1 \leq j \leq N} l\left(q_{i}, d_{i}^{+}, d_{j}^{-}\right)+\sum_{1 \leq k \leq N, k \neq i} l\left(q_{i}, d_{i}^{+}, d_{k}^{+}\right)\right)
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\left(q_{i}, d_{i}^{+}, d_{j}^{-}\right)\)</span> is the loss function for a triplet.</p>
<p>In-batch negative offers an efficient implementation for random negatives. Another way to mitigate the inefficient learning issue is simply use large batch size (&gt;4,000) [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-large-scale-negatives"><span class="std std-ref">Large-Scale Negatives</span></a>].</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">22.6.2.2. </span>Popularity-based Negative Sampling<a class="headerlink" href="#popularity-based-negative-sampling" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Popularity-based negative sampling</strong> use document popularity as the sampling weight to sample negative documents. The popularity of a document can be defined as some combination of click, dwell time, quality, etc. Compared to random negative sampling, this algorithm replaces the uniform distribution with a popularity-based sampling distribution, which can be pre-computed offline.</p>
<p>The major rationale of using popularity-based negative examples is to improve representation learning. <strong>Popular negative documents represent a harder negative compared to a unpopular negative since they tend to have to a higher chance of being more relevant</strong>; that is, lying closer to query in the embedding space. If the model is trained to distinguish these harder cases, the over learned representations will be likely improved.</p>
<p>Popularity-based negative sampling is also used in word2vec training <span id="id37">[<a class="reference internal" href="../chapter_foundation/word_embeddings.html#id1126" title="Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg S Corrado, and Jeff Dean.

For example, the probability to sample a word <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_i\)</span> is given by:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
P\left(w_i\right)=\frac{f\left(w_i\right)^{3 / 4}}{\sum_{j=0}^n\left(f\left(w_j\right)^{3 / 4}\right)},
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(w)\)</span> is the frequency of word <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w\)</span>.

<p>Deep model improves the encoded representation of queries and documents by contrastive learning, in which the model learns to distinguish positive examples and negative examples. A simple random sampling strategy tend to produce a large quantity of easy negative examples since easy negative examples make up the majority of negative examples.

<p>The model learning from easy negative example can quickly plateau since easy negative examples produces vanishing gradients to update the model.

<p>In generating these negative examples, the negative-generation model (e.g., BM25) and the model under training are de-coupled; that is the negative-generation model is not updated during training and the hard examples are static.

<!-- \begin{remark rom ANCE]

	Based on our analysis, we propose Approximate nearest neighbor Negative Contrastive Estimation (ANCE), a new contrastive representation learning mechanism for dense retrieval. Instead of random or in-batch local negatives, ANCE constructs global negatives using the beingoptimized DR model to retrieve from the entire corpus. 

	This fundamentally aligns the distribution of negative samples in training and of irrelevant documents to separate in testing. From the variance reduction perspective, these ANCE negatives lift the upper bound of per instance gradient norm, reduce the variance of the
	stochastic gradient estimation, and lead to faster learning convergence.

<p>Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a well-trained, high-performing yet cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model with significant performance loss. Knowledge distillation has been a widely adopted method to achieve efficient neural network architecture, thus reducing overall inference costs, including memory requirements as well as inference latency. Typically, the teacher model can be an ensemble of separately trained models or a single very large model trained with a very strong regularizer such as dropout. The student model uses the distilled knowledge from the teacher network as additional learning cues. The resulting student model is computationally inexpensive and has accuracy better than directly training it from scratch.</p>
<p>As such, tor retrieval and ranking systems, knowledge distillation is a desirable approach to develop efficient models to meet the high requirement on both accuracy and latency.</p>
<p>For example, one can distill knowledge from a more powerful cross-encoder (e.g., BERT cross-encoder in <a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-monobert"><span class="std std-numref">Section 22.4.4.2</span></a>) to a computational efficient bi-encoders. Empirically, this two-step procedure might be more effective than directly training a bi-encoder from scratch.</p>
<p>In this section, we first review the principle of knowledge distillation. Then we go over a couple examples to demonstrate the application of knowledge distillation in developing retrieval and ranking models.</p>

<p>In the classic knowledge distillation framework <span id="id47">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1302" title="Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeff Dean.

Soft label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> can be viewed as a softened probability vector distributed over class labels of interest.
Soft targets contain valuable information on the rich similarity structure over the data. Use MNIST classification as an example, a reasonable soft target will tell that 2 looks more like 3 than 9. These soft targets can be viewed as a strategy to mitigate the over-confidence issue and reduce gradient variance when we train neural networks using one-hot hard labels. Similar mechanism is leveraged in smooth label to improves model generalization.</p>
<p>Allows the smaller Student model to be trained on much smaller data than the original cumbersome model and with a much higher learning rate</p>
<p>Specifically, the logits <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> from the techer model are outputted to generate soft labels via</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
q_{i}^T=\frac{\exp \left(z_{i} / T\right)}{\sum_{j} \exp \left(z_{j} / T\right)},
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> is the temperature parameter controlling softness of the probability vector, and the sum is over the entire label space. When <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=1\)</span>, it is equivalent to standard Softmax function. As <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> grows, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> become softer and approaches uniform distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=\infty\)</span>. On the other hand, as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\to 0\)</span>, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> approaches a one-hot hard label.</p>

<p>The loss function for the student network training is a weighted sum of the hard label based cross entropy loss and soft label based KL divergence. The rationale of KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence is to use the softened probability vector from the teacher model to guide the learning of the student network. Minimizing the KL divergence constrains the student model’s probabilistic outputs to match soft targets of the teacher model.</p>
<p>The loss function is formally given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[L =(1-\alpha) L_{C E}\left(p, y\right)+\alpha T^{2} {L}_{K L}\left(p^T, q^T\right)\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{CE}\)</span> is the regular cross entropy loss between predicted probability vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> and the one-hot label vector</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{L}_{CE}\left(p, y\right) =-\sum_{j}{y}_{j} \log {p}_{j};\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{KL}\)</span> is the KL divergence loss between the softened predictions at temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> from the student and the teacher networks, respectively:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{L}_{KL}\left({p}^T, q^{T}\right) = -\sum_{j} {q}_{j}^{T} \log \frac{p_{j}^T}{{q}_{j}^{T}}.\]</div>
<p>Note that the same high temperature is used to produce distributions from the student model.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{KL}(p^T, q^T) = L_{CE}(p^T, q^T) + H(q^T, q^T)\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H(q^T, q^T)\)</span> being the entropy of probability vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^T\)</span> and remaining as a constant during the training. As a result, we also often reduce the total loss to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[L =(1-\alpha) L_{C E}\left(p, y\right)+\alpha T^{2} {L}_{CE}\left(p^T, q^T\right).\]</div>
<p>Finally, the multiplier <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T^2\)</span> is used to re-scale the gradient of KL loss and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> is a scalar controlling the weight contribution to each loss.</p>
<p>Besides using softened probability vector and KL divergence loss to guide the student learning process, we can also use MSE loss between the logits from the teacher and the student networks. Specifically,
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{MSE} = ||z^{(T)} - z^{(S)}||^2\)</span>$</p>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z^{(T)}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z^{(S)}\)</span> are logits from the teacher and the student network, respectively.</p>

In this paradigm, there is a single global, static representation for each query and each document. Specifically, the document’s embedding remain the same regardless of the document length, the content structure of document (e.g., multiple topics) and the variation of queries that are relevant to the document. It is very common that a document with hundreds of tokens might contain several distinct subtopics, some important semantic information might be easily missed or biased by each other when compressing a document into a dense vector.  As such, this simple bi-encoder structure may cause serious information loss when used to encode documents. <sup>[^2]</sup></p>
<p>On the other hand,  cross-encoders based on BERT variants [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-sec-classicrepresentationlearning"><span class="std std-numref">Section 22.4.3</span></a>] utilize multiple self-attention layers not only to extract contextualized features from queries and documents but also capture the interactions between them. Cross-encoders only produce intermediate representations that take a pair of query and document as the joint input. While BERT-based cross-encoders brought significant performance gain,  they are computationally prohibitive and impractical for online inference.</p>

<p>There are a couple of steps to calculate the final relevance score between a query and a document.

<p>Query expansion and document expansion techniques provide two potential solutions to the inherent vocabulary mismatch problem in traditional IR systems. The core idea is to add extra relevant terms to queries and documents respectively to aid relevance matching.</p>
<p>Consider an ad-hoc search example of <em>automobile sales per year in the US</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Document expansion can be implemented by appending <em>car</em> in documents that contains the term <em>automobile</em> but not <em>car</em>. Then an exact-match retriever can fetch documents containing either <em>car</em> and <em>automobile</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Query expansion can be accomplished by retrieving results from both the query <em>automobile sales per year in the US</em> and the query <em>car sales per year in the US</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different approaches to coming up suitable terms to expand queries and documents in order to make relevance matching easier. These approaches range from traditional rule-based methods such as synonym expansion to recent learning based approaches by mining user logs. For example, augmented terms for a document can come from queries that are relevant from user click-through logs.</p>

<p>Both query and document expansion can be fit into typical IR architectures through an de-coupled module. A query expansion module takes an input query and output a (richer) expanded query [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-queryexpansionarch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.30</span></a>]. They are also known as query rewriters or expanders. The module might remove terms deemed unnecessary in the user’s query, for example stop words and add extra terms facilitate the engine to retrieve documents with a high recall.</p>

<p>Similarly, document expansion naturally fits into the retrieval and ranking pipeline [<a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-docexpansionarch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.31</span></a>]. The index will be simply built upon the expanded corpus to provide a richer set of candidate documents for retrieval. The extra computation for document expansion can be all carried out offline. Therefore, it presents the same level of effectiveness like query expansion but at lower latency costs (for example, using less computationally intensive rerankers).</p>
<p>Query expansion and document expansion have different pros and cons. Main advantages of query expansions include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Compare to document expansion, query expansion techniques can be quickly implemented and experimented without modifying the entire indexing. On the other hand, experimenting document expansion techniques can be costly and time-consuming, since the entire indexing is affected.</p></li>
<li><p>Query expansion techniques are generally more flexible. For example, it is easy to switch on or off different features at query time (for example, selectively apply expansion only to certain intents or certain query types).
The flexibility of query expansion also allow us insert an expansion module in different stages of the retrieval-ranking pipeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, one unique advantage for document expansion is that: documents are typically much longer than queries, and thus offer more context for a model to choose appropriate expansion terms.

### Pseudo Relevance Feedback

#### Basics

Pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) is another commonly used technique to boost the performance of traditional IR models and to reduce the effect of query-document vocabulary mismatches and improve the estimate the term weights. The interest of using PRF has been recently expanded into the neural IR models {cite}`li2018nprf`.

```{figure} ../img/chapter_application_IR/ApplicationIRSearch/PseudoRelevanceFeedback/PRF_arch.png

A typical architecture for pseudo relevance feedback implementation.
```

{numref}`ch:neural-network-and-deep-learning:ApplicationNLP_IRSearch:fig:prfarch` shows a typical architecture for pseudo relevance feedback implementation. There are two rounds of retrieval. In the initial retrieval, the retriever fetches a batch of relevant documents based on the original query. We can use the top-$k$ documents to expand and refine the original query. In the second round retrieval, the retriever fetches relevant documents as the final result based on the expanded query. Intuitively, the first-round retrieved documents help identify terms not present in the original query that are discriminative of relevant texts. After the expansion, the expanded query effective mitigate the vocabulary gap between original query and the corpus. 

#### Neural Pseudo Relevance Feedback (NPRF)

**Overview**
Given a query q, NPRF estimates the relevance of a target document $d$ relative to $q$ using following key procedures:
	1. Create initial retrieval result. Given a document corpus $\cD$, a simple ranking method (e.g., BM25) $\operatorname{rel}_{q}(q, d)$ is applied to each $d\in \cD$ to obtain the top-$m$ documents, denoted as $D_{q}$ for $q$.
	2. Compute document-document relevance. We extract the relevance between each $d_{q}\in D_{q}$ and the target $q$, using a neural ranking method $\operatorname{rel}_{d}(d_{q}, d)$.
	3. Compute final relevance.  The relevance scores $\operatorname{rel}_{d}(d_{q}, d)$ from previous step weighted by $rel_{q}(q, d_{q})$ to arrive at $\operatorname{rel}'_{d}\left(d_{q}, d\right)$. The weighting which serves as an estimator for the confidence of the contribution of $d_{q}$ relative to $q$. Finally, we relevance between $q$ and $d$ is given by the aggregation of these adjusted relevance scores, $$\operatorname{rel}_{D}(q, D_{q}, d) = \sum_{d_q\in D_q} \operatorname{rel}'_{d}(d_q, d).$$

Overall architecture and procedure for neural pseudo relevance feedback (NPRF) implementation.
```

**Model architecture**

The NPRF framework begins with an initial ranking for the input query $q$ determined by $\operatorname{rel}_{q}(., .)$, which forms $D_{q}$, the set of the top- $m$ documents $D_{q}$. The ultimate query-document relevance score $\operatorname{rel}_{D}\left(q, D_{q}, d\right)$ is computed as follows.

Extracting document interactions. Given the target document $d$ and each feedback document $d_{q} \in D_{q}, r e l_{d}(., .)$ is used to evaluate the relevance between $d$ and $d_{q}$, resulting in $m$ real-valued relevance scores, where each score corresponds to the estimated relevance of $d$ according to one feedback document $d_{q}$.

As mentioned, two NIRMs are separately used to compute rel $_{d}\left(d_{q}, d\right)$ in our experiments. Both models take as input the cosine similarities between each pair of terms in $d_{q}$ and $d$, which are computed using pre-trained word embeddings as explained in Section 3.1. Given that both models consider only unigram matches and do not consider term dependencies, we first summarize $d_{q}$ by retaining only the top- $k$ terms according to their $t f$-idf scores, which speeds up training by reducing the document size and removing noisy terms. In our pilot experiments, the use of top- $k$ tf-idf document summarization did not influence performance. For different $d_{q} \in D_{q}$, the same model is used as $\operatorname{rel}_{d}(., .)$ for different pairs of $\left(d_{q}, d\right)$ by sharing model weights.

Combining document interactions. When determining the relevance of a target document $d$, there exist two sources of relevance signals to consider: the target document's relevance relative to the feedback documents $D_{q}$ and its relevance relative to the query $q$ itself. In this step, we combine rel ${ }_{d}\left(d_{q}, d\right)$ for each $d_{q} \in D_{q}$ into an overall feedback document relevance score

$\operatorname{rel}_{D}\left(q, D_{q}, d\right)$. When combining the relevance scores, the agreement between $q$ and each $d_{q}$ is also important, since $d_{q}$ may differ from $q$ in terms of information needs. The relevance of $d_{q}$ from the initial ranking rel ${ }_{q}\left(q, d_{q}\right)$ is employed to quantify this agreement and weight each $\operatorname{rel}_{d}\left(d_{q}, d\right)$ accordingly.

When computing such agreements, it is necessary to remove the influence of the absolute ranges of the scores from the initial ranker. For example, ranking scores from a language model (Ponte and Croft, 1998) and from BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995) can differ substantially in their absolute ranges. To mitigate this, we use a smoothed $\min -\max$ normalization to rescale $\operatorname{rel}_{q}\left(q, d_{q}\right)$ into the range $[0.5,1]$. The min-max normalization is applied by considering $\min \left(\operatorname{rel}_{q}\left(q, d_{q}\right) \mid d_{q} \in\right.$ $\left.D_{q}\right)$ and $\max \left(r e l_{q}\left(q, d_{q}\right) \mid d_{q} \in D_{q}\right)$. Hereafter, $r_{q} l_{q}\left(q, d_{q}\right)$ is used to denote this relevance score after min-max normalization for brevity. The (normalized) relevance score is smoothed and then weighted by the relevance evaluation of $d_{q}$, producing a weighted document relevance score rel $_{d}{ }^{\prime}\left(d_{q}, d\right)$ for each $d_{q} \in D_{q}$ that reflects the relevance of $d_{q}$ relative to $q$. This computation is described in the following equation.
$$
\operatorname{rel}_{d}{ }^{\prime}\left(d_{q}, d\right)=\operatorname{rel}_{d}\left(d_{q}, d\right)\left(0.5+0.5 \times \operatorname{rel}_{q}\left(q, d_{q}\right)\right)
$$
As the last step, we propose two variants for combining the $r e l_{d}{ }^{\prime}\left(d_{q}, d\right)$ for different $d_{q}$ into a single score $r e l_{D}\left(q, D_{q}, d\right)$ : (i) performing a direct summation and (ii) using a feed forward network with a hyperbolic tangent ( $\tanh$ ) non-linear activation. Namely, the first variant simply sums up the scores, whereas the second takes the ranking positions of individual feedback documents into account.

**Optimization and Training**
Each training sample consists of a query $q$, a set of $m$ feedback documents $D_{q}$, a relevant target document $d^{+}$and a non-relevant target document $d^{-}$according to the ground truth. The Adam optimizer (Kingma and $\mathrm{Ba}, 2014$ ) is used with a learning rate $0.001$ and a batch size of 20 . Training normally converges within 30 epochs, with weights uniformly initialized. A hinge loss is employed for training as shown below.
$$
\operatorname{loss}\left(q, D_{q}, d^{+}, d^{-}\right)= \max \left(0,1-\operatorname{rel}\left(q, D_{q}, d^{+}\right)+\operatorname{rel}\left(q, D_{q}, d^{-}\right)\right)

<p>In ad-hoc search, queries are mainly short and keyword based without complex grammatical structures. To be able to fetch most relevant results, it is  important to take into account term importance. For example,  given the query <em>bitcoin news</em>, a relevant document is expected to be about <em>bitcoin</em> and <em>news</em>, where the term <em>bitcoin</em> is more important than <em>news</em> in the sense that a document describing other aspects of bitcoin would be more relevant than a document describing news of other things.</p>
<p>In the traditional IR framework, term importance is calculated using inverse document frequency. A term is less important if it is a common term appearing in a large number of documents. These frequency-based term weights have been a huge success in traditional IR systems due to its simplicity and scalability. The problematic aspect is that Tf-idf determines the term importance solely based on word counts rather than the semantics. High-frequency words  does not necessarily indicate their central role to the meaning of the text, especially for short texts where the word frequency distribution is quite flat.

#### Learnable Context-aware Term Importance: Deep-Impact

DeepCT has an interesting “quirk”: in truth, it only learns the term frequency (tf) component of term weights, but still relies on the remaining parts of the BM25 scoring function via the gen- eration of pseudo-documents. This approach also has a weakness: it only assigns weights to terms that are already present in the document, which limits retrieval to exact match. This is an impor- tant limitation that is addressed by the use of dense representations, which are capable of capturing semantic matches.

Deep CT learning independent term-level scores without taking into account the term co-occurrences in the document.

DeepCT (Dai and Callan, 2019), which uses a transformer to learn term weights based on a re- gression model, with the supervision signal coming from the MS MARCO passage ranking test collection

DeepImpact brought together two key ideas: the use of document expansion to iden- tify dimensions in the sparse vector that should have non-zero weights and a term weighting model based on a pairwise loss between relevant and non- relevant texts with respect to a query. Expansion

DeepImpact aim at learning the final term impact jointly across all query terms occurring in a passage. 
DeepImpact learns richer interaction patterns among the impacts, when compared to training each im- pact in isolation.

To address vocabulary mismatch, DeepImpact leverages DocT5Query to enrich every document with new terms likely to occur in queries for which the document is relevant. 

**Network architecture**  The overall architecture of the Deeplmpact neural network is depicted in Figure 1. Deeplmpact feeds a contextual LM encoder the original document terms (in white) and the injected expansion terms (in gray), separating both by a [SEP] separator token to distinguish both contexts. The LM encoder produces an embedding for each input term. The first occurrence of each unique term is provided as input to the impact score encoder, which is a two-layer MLP with ReLU activations. This produces a single-value **positive score** for each unique term in the document, representing its impact. Given a query $q$, we model the score of document $d$ as simply the sum of impacts for the intersection of terms in $q$ and $d$. That is,
$$s(q, d) = \sum_{t\in q\cap d} \operatorname{ScoreEncoder}(h_t).$$

For each triple, two scores for the corresponding two documents are computed. The model is optimized via pairwise Softmax cross- entropy loss over the computed scores of the documents.

DeepImpact architecture.
```

**Quantization and Query Processing.** In our approach we predict real-valued document-term scores, also called impact scores, that we store in the inverted index. Since storing a floating point value per posting would blow up the space requirements of the inverted index, we decided to store impacts in a quantized form. The quantized impact scores belong to the range of $\left[1,2^{b}-1\right]$, where $b$ is the number of bits used to store each value. We experimented with b = 8 using linear quantization, and did not notice any loss in precision w.r.t. the original scores. Since

### Contextualized Sparse Representation

#### Motivation

An important point to make here is that neural networks, particularly transformers, have not made sparse representations obsolete. Both dense and sparse learned representations clearly exploit transformers-the trick is that the latter class of techniques then "projects" the learned knowledge back into the sparse vocabulary space. This allows us to reuse decades of innovation in inverted indexes (e.g., integer coding techniques to compress inverted lists) and efficient query evaluation algorithms (e.g., smart skipping to reduce query latency): for example, the Lucene index used in our uniCOIL experiments is only $1.3 \mathrm{&nbsp;GB}$, compared to $\sim 40$ GB for COIL-tok, 26 GB for TCTColBERTv2, and 154 GB for ColBERT. We note, however, that with dense retrieval techniques, fixedwidth vectors can be approximated with binary hash codes, yielding far more compact representations with sacrificing much effectiveness (Yamada et al., 2021). Once again, no clear winner emerges at present.

The complete design space of modern information retrieval techniques requires proper accounting of the tradeoffs between output quality (effectiveness), time (query latency), and space (index size). Here, we have only focused on the first aspect. Learned representations for information retrieval are clearly the future, but the advantages and disadvantages of dense vs. sparse approaches along these dimensions are not yet fully understood. It'll be exciting to see what comes next!

#### COIL-token And Uni-COIL

The recently proposed COIL architecture (Gao et al., 2021a) presents an interesting case for this conceptual framework. Where does it belong? The authors themselves describe COIL as "a new exact lexical match retrieval architecture armed with deep LM representations". COIL produces representations for each document token that are then directly stored in the inverted index, where the term frequency usually goes in an inverted list. Although COIL is perhaps best described as the intellectual descendant of ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), another way to think about it within our conceptual framework is that instead of assignmodel assigns each term a vector "weight". Query evaluation in COIL involves accumulating inner products instead of scalar weights.

```{figure} ../img/chapter_application_IR/ApplicationIRSearch/ContextualizedSparseEmbedding/COIL_tok_embedding
:name: fig:coiltokembedding

```

In another interesting extension, if we reduce the token dimension of COIL to one, the model degenerates into producing scalar weights, which then becomes directly comparable to DeepCT, row (2a) and the "no-expansion" variant of DeepImpact, row (2c). These comparisons isolate the effects of different term weighting models. We dub this variant of COIL "uniCOIL", on top of which we can also add doc2query-T5, which produces a fair comparison to DeepImpact, row ( $2 \mathrm{&nbsp;d})$. The original formulation of COIL, even with a token dimension of one, is not directly amenable to retrieval using inverted indexes because weights can be negative. To address this issue, we added a ReLU operation on the output term weights of the base COIL model to force the model to generate non-negative weights. -->

<p>Quantization is a technique widely used to reduce the cardinality of high dimensional representation space, in particular when the input data is real-valued.</p>
<p>Formally, a <strong>quantizer</strong> is a function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> mapping a multi-dimensional vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^{D}\)</span> to a pre-defined centroid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q(x) = c_i\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_i \in \mathcal{C} = \{c_1,...,c_{k}\}\)</span>.
The values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_i \in \mathbb{R}^D\)</span> are called <strong>centroids</strong>, and the set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is the <em>codebook</em> of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>The set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{V}_{i}\)</span> of vectors mapped to a given index <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> is referred to as a (Voronoi) cell, and defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mathcal{V}_{i} \triangleq\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{D}: q(x)=c_{i}\right\}.
\]</div>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> cells of a quantizer form a partition of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{R}^{D}\)</span>. By definition, all the vectors lying in the same cell <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{V}_{i}\)</span> are reconstructed by the same centroid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{i}\)</span>. That is, they are all <strong>approximated</strong> by centroid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>How do we measure the approximation quality of such representation? The quality of a quantizer is usually measured by the mean squared error between the input vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and its reproduction value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q(x):\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\operatorname{MSE}(q)=\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[d(q(x), x)^{2}\right]=\int p(x) d(q(x), x)^{2} d x
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d(x, y)=\|x-y\|\)</span> is the Euclidean distance between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, and where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p(x)\)</span> is the probability distribution function corresponding the randomly sampled <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. Approximate calculation of the integral can be achieved by Monte-Carlo sampling.</p>
<p>In order for the quantizer to be optimal, it has to satisfy two properties known as the Lloyd optimality conditions. First, a vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> must be quantized to its nearest codebook centroid, in terms of the Euclidean distance:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
q(x)=\arg \min _{\mathrm{s}_{i} \in \mathcal{C}} d\left(x, c_{1}\right)
\]</div>
<p>As a result, the cells are delimited by hyperplanes. The second Lloyd condition is that the reconstruction value must be the expectation of the vectors lying in the Voronoi cell:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
c_{i}=\mathbb{E}_{X}[x \mid i]=\int_{V_{i}} p(x) x d x .
\]</div>
<p>The Lloyd quantizer, which corresponds to the <strong><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-means clustering algorithm</strong>, finds a near-optimal codebook by iteratively assigning the vectors of a training set to centroids and re-estimating these centroids from the assigned vectors.</p>

<p>The <strong>storage</strong> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> vectors now reduce to storage of their index values plus the centroids in the codebook.

<p>Two important benefits to compressing the dataset are that (1) memory access times are generally the limiting factor on processing speed, and (2) sheer memory capacity can be a problem for big datasets.</p>

<p>Let us consider a quantizer producing 64 bits codes, i.e., which can contain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=2^{64} \approx 1.8\times 10^{19} \)</span> centroids. It is prohibitive run the k-means algorithm and practically impossible to store the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D \times k\)</span> floating point values representing the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> centroids.</p>
<p>Product quantization serves as an efficient solution to address these computation and memory consumption issues in vector quantization. The key idea of product quantization is <strong>grouping and splitting</strong>[ <a class="reference internal" href="#ch-neural-network-and-deep-learning-applicationnlp-irsearch-fig-codebookmemorysavingdemoproductquantization"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22.37</span></a>]. The input vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is split into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> distinct subvectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u_{j}, 1 \leq\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \leq m\)</span> of dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D^{*}=D / m\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>. The subvectors are then quantized separately using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> distinct quantizers. A given vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is therefore quantized as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\underbrace{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D^{*}}}_{u_{1}(x)}, \ldots, \underbrace{x_{D-D^{*}+1}, \ldots, x_{D}}_{u_{m}(x)} \rightarrow q_{1}\left(u_{1}(x)\right), \ldots, q_{m}\left(u_{m}(x)\right),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{j}\)</span> is a quantizer used to quantize the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j^{\text {th }}\)</span> subvector using the codebook <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{C}_{j} = \{c_{j,1},...,c_{j,k^*}\}\)</span>.

<p>In this case, a reproduction value of the product quantizer is identified by an element of the product index set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{I}=\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{I}_{1} \times \ldots \times \mathcal{I}_{m}\)</span>. The codebook is therefore defined as the Cartesian product</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}_{1} \times \ldots \times \mathcal{C}_{m}
\]</div>
<p>and a centroid of this set is the concatenation of centroids of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> subquantizers. In that case, the total number of centroids is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
k=\left(k^{*}\right)^{m}
\]</div>
<p>Note that in the extremal case where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m=D\)</span>, the components of a vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> are all quantized separately. Then the product quantizer turns out to be a scalar quantizer, where the quantization function associated with each component may be different.</p>
<p>The strength of a product quantizer is to produce a large set of centroids from several small groups of centroids; each group is associated with its own subquantizer.</p>
<!-- 
\iffalse
Storing the codebook $\mathcal{C}$ explicitly is not efficient. Instead, we store the $m \times k^{*}$ centroids of all the subquantizers, i.e., $m D^{*} k^{*}=k^{*} D$ floating points values. Quantizing an element requires $k^{*} D$ floating point operations. Table I summarizes the resource requirements associated with k-means, HKM and product $k$-means. The product quantizer is clearly the the only one that can be indexed in memory for large values of $k$.

{\begin{tabular}{lcc} 
	& memory usage & assignment complexity \\
	\hline k-means & $k D$ & $k D$ \\
	product k-means & $m k^{*} D^{*}=k^{1 / m} D$ & $m k^{*} D^{*}=k^{1 / m} D$ \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
}

In order to provide good quantization properties when choosing a constant value of $k^{*}$, each subvector should have, on average, a comparable energy. One way to ensure this property is to multiply the vector by a random orthogonal matrix prior to quantization. However, for most vector types this is not required and not recommended, as consecutive components are often correlated by construction and are better quantized together with the same subquantizer. As the subspaces are orthogonal, the squared distortion associated with the product quantizer is
$$
\operatorname{MSE}(q)=\sum_{j} \operatorname{MSE}\left(q_{j}\right)
$$
where $\operatorname{MSE}\left(q_{j}\right)$ is the distortion associated with quantizer $q_{j}$. Figure 1 shows the MSE as a function of the code length for different $\left(m, K^{*}\right)$ tuples, where the code length is $l=m \log _{2} K^{*}$, if $K^{*}$ is a power of two. The curves are obtained for a set of 128-dimensional SIFT descriptors, see section $\mathrm{V}$ for details. One can observe that for a fixed number of bits, it is better to use a small number of subquantizers with many centroids than having many subquantizers with few bits. At the extreme when $m=1$, the product quantizer becomes a regular k-means codebook.

High values of $K^{*}$ increase the computational cost of the quantizer, as shown by Table I. They also increase the memory usage of storing the centroids $\left(K^{*} \times D\right.$ floating point values), which further reduces the efficiency if the centroid look-up table does no longer fit in cache memory. In the case where $m=1$, we can not afford using more than 16 bits to keep this cost tractable. Using $K*=256, m=8$ is often a reasonable choice.

<p>While performing approximate nearest neighbor search with vector quantization or product quantization can already achieve computation acceleration and storage saving in the distance calculation, the search is still exhaustive in which we are computing distance between the query vector and all the vectors in the database. Exhaustive search is not scalable to database containing billions of vectors and scenarios having high query through-puts.</p>
<p>To avoid exhaustive search we can design a hierarchical quantization strategy to reduce the number of candidates that we will run distance calculation and use product quantization to speed up the distance calculation.</p>
<p>The candidate reduction is achieved via a technique called <strong>inverted file index</strong> (IVF). IVF applies vector quantization via  k-means clustering to produce a large number (e.g., 100) of dataset partitions. At the query time, we identify the a number (e.g., 10) of partitions that are the nearest to the query and only compare the query vector to database vector in the these partitions. The residual distance between each vector and its associated partition centroid is approximated by a residual product quantization.</p>
<p>In sparse retrieval, inverted indexing refers to the mapping from a term to a list of documents in the database that contain the term. It resemble the index in the back of a textbook, which maps words or concepts to page numbers</p>
<p>In the context of vector quantization for efficient dense retrieval, we use k-means clustering to partition all vectors in the dataset.<br />
For each partition, an inverted file list refers to the document vectors and its corresponding document ids belonging to this partition.</p>
<p>Given a query, once we determine which partition the query belongs to (using a quantizer), we reduce the search space to the documents in the same partition.</p>
<p>So far, there are two layers of quantization, which are realized through a <strong>coarse quantizer</strong> and a <strong>residual  product quantizer</strong>. More formally, we denote the centroid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{\mathrm{c}}(y)\)</span> associated with a vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>. Then the product quantizer <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{\mathrm{p}}\)</span> is used to encode the residual vector</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
r(y)=y-q_{\mathrm{c}}(y)
\]</div>
<p>corresponding to the offset in the Voronoi cell. The energy of the residual vector is small compared to that of the vector itself. The vector is approximated by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\tilde{y} = q_{\mathrm{c}}(y)+q_{\mathrm{p}}\left(y-q_{\mathrm{c}}(y)\right).
\]</div>
<p>Commonly we represent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> by the tuple <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(q_{\mathrm{c}}(y), q_{\mathrm{p}}(r(y))\right)\)</span>. Like binary representation of a number, the coarse quantizer part represents the most significant bits, while the product quantizer part represents the least significant bits.</p>
<div class="proof remark admonition" id="remark-3">
<p class="admonition-title"><span class="caption-number">Remark 22.3 </span> (shared product quantizer for residuals)</p>
<section class="remark-content" id="proof-content">
<p>The product quantizer can be learned on a set of residual vectors. Ideally, we can learn a product quantizer for each partition since the residual vectors likely to be dependent on the coarse quantizer. One can further reduce memory cost significantly by using the same product quantizer across all coarse quantizers, although this probably gives inferior results</p>

answering. MS MARCO dataset is sampled from Bing search engine user logs, with Bing retrieved passages given queries and human annotated relevance labels. There are more than 530,000 questions in the “train” data partition, and the evaluation is usually performed on around 6,800 questions in the “dev” and “eval” data partition. The ground-truth labels for the “eval” partition are not published. The original data set contains more than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8.8\)</span> million passages.</p>
<p>There are two tasks: Passage ranking and document ranking; and two subtasks in each case: full ranking and re-ranking.</p>
<p>Each task uses a large human-generated set of training labels. The two tasks have different sets of test queries. Both tasks use similar form of training data with usually one positive training document/passage per training query. In the case of passage ranking, there is a direct human label that says the passage can be used to answer the query, whereas for training the document ranking task we transfer the same passage-level labels to document-level labels. Participants can also use external corpora for large scale language model pretraining, or adapt algorithms built for one task (e.g. passage ranking) to the other task (e.g. document ranking). This allows participants to study a variety of transfer learning strategies.</p>
<section id="document-ranking-task">
<h4><span class="section-number">22.12.1.1. </span>Document Ranking Task<a class="headerlink" href="#document-ranking-task" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The first task focuses on document ranking. We have two subtasks related to this: Full ranking and top-100 re-ranking.</p>
<p>In the full ranking (retrieval) subtask, you are expected to rank documents based on their relevance to the query, where documents can be retrieved from the full document collection provided. You can submit up to 100 documents for this task. It models a scenario where you are building an end-to-end retrieval system.</p>
<p>In the re-ranking subtask, we provide you with an initial ranking of 100 documents from a simple IR system, and you are expected to re-rank the documents in terms of their relevance to the question. This is a very common real-world scenario, since many end-to-end systems are implemented as retrieval followed by top-k re-ranking. The re-ranking subtask allows participants to focus on re-ranking only, without needing to implement an end-to-end system. It also makes those re-ranking runs more comparable, because they all start from the same set of 100 candidates.</p>

		{\scriptsize NA} &  D2342771     \url{http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-4-best-strategies-for-dealing-with-customer-service-2014-08-14}     The 4 best st
		rategies for dealing with customer service Shutterstock.com / wavebreakmedia If you want your cable company, airline or pretty much any other company to resolve your complaints quickly and completely, you may need to change the way you deal with customer service. According to the latest data from the American Customer Service Index, Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the companies they deal with. In the first quarter of 2014, overall customer satisfaction scores across all industries fell to 76.2 out of 100, which the researchers who compile the ratings say was “one of the largest [drops] in the 20-year history of the Index.” And some industries are particularly hated: Internet (63 out of 100) and cable and subscription TV (65) companies and airlines (69) rank at the bottom when it comes to customer satisfaction. Part of the dissatisfaction may be because we are interacting with customer service the wrong way. A report released Wednesday by customer-service software firm Zendesk, which looked at customer-service interactions from more than 25,000 companies across 140 countries, as well as insight from customer-service experts, found that some consumers are acting in ways that aren’t yielding them good results. Here are four strategies to employ when dealing with customer service. Don’t be too stern Being “overbearing” or “overly stern” is “a common strategy for some customers seeking better service,” the Zendesk survey revealed. “However, the data indicates that customers who are polite tend to submit higher customer satisfaction scores than those who aren’t.”	Indeed, customers who ask the customer service rep to “please” help them with their request, and who said “thank you” for help they received throughout the call reported that they got better customer service than those who did not use these words, the survey showed. Of course, it could be that people who use these words tend to be more satisfied anyway. But there’s a strong chance that saying these platitudes ingratiates the customer service rep to you -- making them more willing to help you quickly and kindly with your request, experts say. “If you can find any excuse at all to praise them and build them up -- ‘you’re very good at what you do,’ ‘I really appreciate the extra effort,’ — people will almost always bend over backwards to maintain that good opinion and to show you just how good they really are,” says Barry Maher, the author of “Filling the Glass,” which focuses in part on getting better customer service and on personal empowerment. “Treat people well who aren’t used to being treated well…and you may well be astonished by the results you get.” Chip Bell, the founder of business consulting firm Chip Bell Group and author of “The 9 1/2 Principles of Innovative Service” adds that “you don’t have to be from the South to show respect with a liberal amount of ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am — it will open doors otherwise closed.”At the very least, “don’t go in guns a’ blazing,” says Shep Hyken, author of “Amaze Every Customer Every Time.” “The moment you lose your cool is the moment you lose control.” And, if that kindness does not work — rather than starting to get nasty — simply ask to speak to a higher authority, says Maher. Take notes Take a lesson from Rich Davis, the Comcast customer who recorded his call with the company and saw it go viral: It often pays to have good records of the antics a company is up to if you want to get your way down the road. “Have you ever heard a recording when you call for assistance that stated, ‘be advised this call may be recorded for quality assurance,’?” says motivational coach and speaker Chantay Bridges. “Flip the script, let the rep know: you are documenting them and keeping a record, that their service is also being noted.” While few customers keep detailed notes or recordings of their interactions, experts say, this will help them should there be a problem down the road, as they’ll have proof of what went on. Don’t keep your problems to yourself Most customers know that they should contact customer service via multiple channels like phone, email and social media to get their complaint resolved ASAP. But few take the logical next step: contacting competitors via these channels too to explain how their current company is not serving their needs. “If you receive a response from a competitor, watch or ask for a counter from the business you originally were contacting,” says John Huehn, CEO of In the Chat, which provides social media and text
		messaging platforms to enhance customer service. This could provide you with the leverage you need to get your issue resolved. It’s OK to keep it brief When it comes to email complaints, longer isn’t better, so don’t waste your breath (you might, after all, need that energy for dealing with the company later on). While experts often advise consumers to give customer service reps as many details as possible so they can effectively fix the customer’s complaint, customers who wrote long emails didn’t report getting any better customer service than those who wrote short ones, the Zendesk survey revealed. Indeed, the customer’s satisfaction levels at the end of
		the exchange were roughly the same whether they wrote 50 words or 200 words. Jason Maynard, product manager and data science lead at Zendesk, says that this doesn’t mean you should not include detail (indeed, that helps) but that you should make this detail as succinct as possible; if you have a complicated problem or request, you may want to consider calling, as most of us aren’t trained as technical writers. \\

<h4><span class="section-number">22.12.1.2. </span>Passage Ranking Task<a class="headerlink" href="#passage-ranking-task" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Similar to the document ranking task, the passage ranking task also has a full ranking and reranking subtasks.</p>
<p>In context of full ranking (retrieval) subtask, given a question, you are expected to rank passages from the full collection in terms of their likelihood of containing an answer to the question. You can submit up to 1,000 passages for this end-to-end retrieval task.</p>
<p>In context of top-1000 reranking subtask, we provide you with an initial ranking of 1000 passages and you are expected to rerank these passages based on their likelihood of containing an answer to the question. In this subtask, we can compare different reranking methods based on the same initial set of 1000 candidates, with the same rationale as described for the document reranking subtask.</p>
<p>One caveat of the MSMARCO collection is that only contains binary annotations for fewer than two positive examples per query, and no explicit annotations for non-relevant passages. During the reranking task, negative examples are generated from the top candidates of a traditional retrieval system. This approach works reasonably well, but accidentally picking relevant passages as negative examples is possible.</p>

[^1]: Semantic matching means words (or phrases) have similar meaning despite they are different words

[^2]: This is also known as query agnostic problem {cite}`tang2021improving`.

[^3]: To avoid excessive memory usage, we truncate each document to 400 tokens and queries to 100 tokens.

[^4]: Let $L = \sum_j q_j\log p_j$, where $p_j = \exp(z_j)/\sum_j\exp(z_j)$. Use $\log q_i = z_i - \log (\sum_j \exp(z_j))$, we have
	```{math}
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} &= \sum_j q_j (\delta_{ij} - p_j) \\
	& =(q_i - p_i)
	\end{align*}
	```
