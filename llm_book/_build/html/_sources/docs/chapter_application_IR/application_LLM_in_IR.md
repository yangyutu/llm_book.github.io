### Natural Language Queries

| Question Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fact-based | Questions that seek specific facts or information. |
| Multi-hop | Questions that require reasoning over multiple pieces of information or relationships. |
| Numerical | Questions that involve numerical values or calculations. |
| Tabular | Questions that relate to data presented in tables. |
| Temporal | Questions that involve time-related information or events. |
| Multi-constraint | Questions that involve multiple constraints or conditions. |

Examples

| Question Type | Query Examples |
| :---: | :--- |
| Fact-based | What is the capital of France? <br> Who invented the telephone? <br> What is the population of Tokyo? |
| Multi-hop | Who is the CEO of the company that manufactures the iPhone? <br> What is the name of the river that flows through London? <br> What is the highest mountain in the country where the Taj Mahal is located? |
| Numerical | What is the average temperature in July in London? <br> What is the distance between New York and Los Angeles? <br> What is the GDP of Japan? |
| Tabular | Which country has the highest population density? <br> What is the average number of mobile phones sold by all the showrooms in the year 2007 ? <br> How many restaurants are in the American cuisine type? |
| Temporal | When did World War II end? <br> Who was the president of the United States in 1963? <br> What was the price of gold in 2008? |
| Multi-constraint | Find a hotel in Paris that has a swimming pool and is within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. <br> What are some laptops that have a 15 -inch screen, 16 GB of RAM, and cost less than $\$ 1,000$ ? <br> Is it possible to constrain the flat face of a say 6 countersunk screws to a single face? |
